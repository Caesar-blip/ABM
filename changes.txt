1. Initiliaze population:
    - Uniform age distribution between 20 and 99
    - Draw income from age distribution, so it's not a paramater
    - Housing and rental prices from CBS distribution
    - Initial savings from normal distribution mean 50000, variance 50000
    - Risk averse index
2. Burnin period:
    - Let the model run for 80 steps, now there is a whole new population
    - Start measuring the effect of initial savings for whealth throughout life
3. During the run:
    - When an agent dies, initialize a new one
    - When agent ages, change there income
    - At every step, give them a chance to list their home based on utility

- Research question:
    How does an initial saving influence your wealth at age 70?

    How does initials savings incfluence the Gini coefficient?

    -Subquestion:
        What risk strategy is best when your poor/rich?
